                        Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language. 
                     <br>   Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation. 
                     <br>   Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms,
                     <br>   including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming.
                     <br>   It is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library. 
                     <br>   Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC programming language
                     <br>   and first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0.[34] Python 2.0 was released in 2000 and introduced new features such as list
                     <br>   comprehensions, cycle-detecting garbage collection, reference counting, and Unicode support. 
                     <br>   Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision that is not completely backward-compatible with earlier versions. 
                     <br>   Python 2 was discontinued with version 2.7.18 in 2020.
